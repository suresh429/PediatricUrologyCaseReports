As a form of energy, ultrasound has effects in insonated tissues that are caused by two main mechanisms: thermal and nonthermal (also known as mechanical). Onscreen indicators of these potential bioeffects are the thermal and mechanical indices. Biological effects of ultrasound have been reported in animals but no harmful effects have been demonstrated in human epidemiological studies. However, all epidemiological studies published so far are based on information obtained with pre-1992 machines, when acoustic intensities for fetal use of ultrasound instruments were allowed to be increased by a factor of almost eight. Many applications are used to scan the fetus and, increasingly, this is performed early in gestation, a time when the fetus is known to be particularly sensitive to external influences. While dating and location of the gestation and verification of the number of fetuses have long been employed in clinical obstetrics, several more recently described applications include, for instance, early anatomy survey for structural anomalies and screening for genetic disorders. All are, generally, performed only with B-mode, but some more recently reported studies use Doppler technology, known to potentially expose the fetus to much higher levels of acoustic energy, such as analysis of the ductus venosus or cardiac function. Ultrasound is a crucial tool in clinical obstetrics, it allows assessment of fetal anatomy, behavior and function. However, it needs to be used with precaution, particularly in early pregnancy. There should always be a medical indication and personnel should be aware of safety and potential bioeffects. End-users should follow the rule of the shortest time possible, at the lowest possible output, compatible with an adequate diagnosis<\/p>","abstractlink":"ultrasound-imaging-of-the-early-fetus--is-it-safe-14536.html","pdflink":"https://www.openaccessjournals.com/articles/ultrasound-imaging-of-the-early-fetus--is-it-safe.pdf","fulltextlink":null,"page_num":"85 - 95","volume":"Volume 13, Issue 2","year":"2021","pub_date":"2021-02-16","art_img":"ultrasound-imaging-of-the-early-fetus-is-it-safe-14536.pdf","date":"2021-03-01","vol":"13","issue":"2","journal":"fmim","rel_keyword":"articles","jshort_name":null},{"sno":"14535","access_type":"open access","art_type":"Review Article","title":"Imaging autoimmune pancreatitis.","author_names":"Irie, Nojiri, Kamochi","abstract":"<p>Computed tomography and MRI findings of 40 cases of autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) were reviewed, and AIP classified into three types: diffuse, segmental and multifocal.

The important differential diagnosis of diffuse type AIP is lymphoma. Differentiating clues are main pancreatic duct change and enhancement pattern on dynamic study. Differentiation between segmental type AIP and pancreatic cancer is often difficult or may be almost impossible. Although rare, AIP may show multifocal delayed enhanced masses within the pancreas.

Rapid technological advances have rendered CT coronary angiography a robust, accurate and fast imaging modality to assess coronary artery disease in selected patients. Difficulties in imaging coronary arteries are mainly due to the small vessel size, the tortuous course of the coronary arteries along the heart surface and the fact that the coronary vessels are in constant motion with varying motion velocity during the cardiac cycle. The rotation speed of modern CT systems, the increased spatial and temporal resolution and the ability to time the scan to match the cardiac cycle by means of the ECG signal all assist to minimize cardiac-motion artifacts and allow for the accurate analysis of coronary conditions. Cardiac CT has been established as a comprehensive evaluation method allowing not only assessment of coronary artery stenosis and coronary anomalies, but also permitting analysis of cardiac function, cardiac valve morphology and aortocoronary bypass grafts, and providing highly detailed information about the aorta, pulmonary arteries and veins, lung and mediastinum.
